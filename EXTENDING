* How to add a new TM algorithms

(Note: this file is best viewed in emacs org mode or emacs outline mode)

* Step 1: Implement your TM

The first step is to create your new implementation.  For now, this entails
creating a single .cpp file in the lib/ folder.  In that file, the following
must be defined:

namespace stm
{
  void tm_sys_init()
  void tm_sys_shutdown()
  const char* tm_getalgname()
  void tm_begin()
  void tm_end()
  void tm_thread_init()
  void tm_thread_shutdown()
  void* tm_alloc(size_t s)
  void tm_free(void* p)
  void* tm_read(void** addr)
  void tm_write(void** addr, void* val)
}

Note: it is likely that you will need to declare a stm::TX struct for storing
per-thread metadata.  For the time being, each implementation defines its own
stm::TX object.

* Step 2: Update build/algs.mk

The second step is to add the name of your stm's cpp file to the ALGNAMES
define in build/algs.mk.  This ensures that your algorithm name will be
visible to benchmarks (see step 4).

* Step 3: Update lib/Makefile

Unless you added additional cpp files that must be built, you should not need
to update lib/Makefile.

* Step 4: Update bench/Makefile

This is an annoying step.  We currently have two different library APIs: one
for CGL, where the loads and stores are inlined, and one for everything else,
where the loads and stores are not inlined.  Thus for a given benchmark, we
must compile twice: once to build with lockapi instrumentation, and once to
compile with genericapi instrumentation.  We also must link S times, where S
is the number of different TM libraries in the ALGNAMES define (see step 2).
(Remember: lockapi is for CGL and any other TM that does not require
instrumentation on loads/stores; genericapi is for everything else).

In reality, what this means is that one api is favored, and the other isn't.
If your TM uses the lockapi, you need to add a 3-line build rule to create
the microbenchmark exes for your new algorithm.  This rule should follow the
cgl build (search for "lockapi builds are likely to be less common").

If you are building to the genericapi, then you don't need to edit the
bench/Makefile at all.

* Step 5: Update stamp-xxx/Makefile

The same annoying and brittle mechanism is needed in the STAMP Makefile,
where a 3-line target and build rule is needed to indicate how to link a
STAMP benchmark to your library .a file if your library uses lockapi.
